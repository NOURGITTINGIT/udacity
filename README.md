# (Loan Data Exploration)
## by Nour El Hedi Zrelli


## Dataset

This dataset contains informations about 113937 loans with 81 variables on each loan such as loan original amount, borrower rate ( interest rate ), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. 

## Summary of Findings

Loans are mostly multiples of 1k.

We can categorize the loans into two categories according to the loan original amount : loans less than 25 k and loans over 25k.The loans with an amount less than 25k seem to have a borrower APR between 0.02 and 0.4, for loans with an amount over 25k the APR is between 0.1 and 0.2.

The BorrowerAPR is high for unemployed people : 75% of unemployed people gets an APR over 0.2. For the employed and retired people, the APR seems balanced : 50% of people gets an API over 0.2.

For people with HR rating, only 3-year loans are given.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I will focus on the Borrower APR and two main features that seems to be affecting it the most, which are the loan original amount and the employment status.
